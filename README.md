<details>
 <summary>NLP covers two application-domains NLU + NLG</summary>


 Natural Language Understanding [(NLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding): It is considered a "Hard AI-problem". The ambiguity and creativity of human language are just two of the characteristics that make NLP a demanding area to work in. The goal is to resolve ambiguities, obtain context and understand the meaning of what's being said. In particular, it tackles the complexities of language beyond the basic sentence structure. NLU is commonly used in [text mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) to understand consumer attitudes. In particular, sentiment analysis enables brands to monitor their customer feedback more closely, allowing them to cluster positive and negative social media comments and track net promoter scores. NLU can also establish a relevant [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)): a data structure which specifies the relationships between words and phrases. While humans naturally do this in [conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis), the combination of these analyses is required for a machine to understand the intended meaning of different texts.
    
Natural Language Generation [(NLG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation): While NLU focuses on computers to comprehend human language, NLG enables computers to write. Initially, NLG systems used templates to generate text. Based on some data or query, an NLG system would fill in the blank, like a game of Mad Libs. But over time, natural language generation systems have evolved with the application of hidden Markov chains, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, enabling more dynamic text generation in real time. Given an internal representation, this involves selecting the right words, forming phrases and sentences. Sentences need to ordered so that information is conveyed correctly. It produces a human language text response based on some data input. This text can also be converted into a speech format through text-to-speech services.



NLU is about both analysis and synthesis ---understanding---.  Sentiment analysis and semantic search are examples of NLU. Captioning an image or video is mainly an NLG ---generating--- task since this type of input is not "textual". Text summarization and chatbot are applications that involve both [NLU + NLG](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2020/11/nlp-vs-nlu-vs-nlg-the-differences-between-three-natural-language-processing-concepts/). NLG also encompasses text summarization capabilities that generate summaries from input documents while maintaining the integrity of the information.

### Pre-Processing of free-texts & the NLP-data Pipeline

As mentioned earlier, NLP software typically analyzes text by breaking it up into
words (tokens) and sentences. Hence, any NLP pipeline has to start with a reliable
system to split the text into sentences (sentence segmentation) and further split a sentence
into words (word tokenization). On the surface, these seem like simple tasks,
and you may wonder why they need special treatment.

>NLP software typically works at the sentence level and
expects a separation of words at the minimum. So, we need some way to split a text
into words and sentences before proceeding further in a processing pipeline. Sometimes,
we need to remove special characters and digits, and sometimes, we don’t care
whether a word is in upper or lowercase and want everything in lowercase. Many
more decisions like this are made while processing text. Such decisions are addressed
during the pre-processing step of the NLP pipeline.

### NLP OPEN-SOURCE Python Tools

To harnass NLP capabilities, there are high quality open-source NLP tools available allowing developers to discover valuable insights from unstructured texts.
That is, dealing with text analysis problems like classification, word ambiguity, sentiment analysis etc.

The here shown inventory is given on state-of-the-art  ---[Python programming language based](https://www.python.org/)--- open-source natural-language processing (NLP) tools & software.
